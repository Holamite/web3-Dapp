# Solidity Learning Project

Welcome to my Solidity Learning Project! This folder contains the Solidity smart contract files that I've been working on during my learning journey. My focus has been on understanding the basics of Solidity, implementing getter and setter functions, and deploying contracts to the Sepolia testnet.

## Learning Objectives

As part of my Solidity learning journey, I've been working on the following key concepts:

1. **Getter and Setter Functions:** Implementing basic getter and setter functions within a smart contract to retrieve and modify data on the blockchain.

2. **Contract Deployment to Sepolia Testnet:** Deploying the developed smart contract to the Sepolia testnet for testing and learning purposes.

## Smart Contract Overview

The primary smart contract in this folder includes basic functionality such as setting and retrieving a message. It serves as a foundational piece for my hands-on experience with Solidity.

## Contract Address on Sepolia Testnet

The smart contract has been deployed to the Sepolia testnet with the following address:

**Contract Address:** `0x934932752EDDeb6150e412E04D747bd974164A7d`

Feel free to explore the contract on the Sepolia testnet or interact with it using the provided address.

## How to Use

While this folder primarily contains Solidity files, the associated JavaScript files in the root directory demonstrate how to interact with the deployed contract using ethers.js.

For deployment, please refer to the deployment scripts in the `scripts/` directory.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

## Disclaimer

This project is part of my ongoing learning process, and the code within this folder may be subject to modifications and improvements as I continue to deepen my understanding of Solidity and smart contract development.

Happy coding!
