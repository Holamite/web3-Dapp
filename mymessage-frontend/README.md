# Smart Contract Interaction Project

Welcome to my Smart Contract Interaction project! This project was created as part of my two-week learning journey to practice and understand the process of interacting with Ethereum smart contracts using Hardhat and ethers.js.

## Project Overview

This project consists of a simple React frontend that allows users to interact with an Ethereum smart contract deployed on a testnet. The smart contract includes basic functions such as setting and retrieving a message.

## Learning Goals

During the past two weeks, I focused on the following key learning objectives:

1. **Setting Up a Hardhat Project:** Understanding the basics of setting up a Hardhat project for Ethereum smart contract development.

2. **Smart Contract Deployment:** Learning how to compile and deploy a smart contract to a testnet using Hardhat.

3. **Frontend Integration:** Integrating the frontend with the smart contract using ethers.js to send transactions and retrieve data.

4. **Continuous Deployment:** Exploring the deployment of the React frontend on popular platforms like Netlify and Vercel.

## Project Structure

- `contracts/`: Contains the Solidity smart contract files.
- `scripts/`: Includes deployment scripts for deploying the smart contract.
- `src/`: Contains the React frontend code.
- `hardhat.config.js`: Configuration file for the Hardhat project.
- `abi.json`: JSON file containing the ABI (Application Binary Interface) of the smart contract.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-contract-interaction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd smart-contract-interaction`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the Hardhat local node: `npx hardhat node`
5.
